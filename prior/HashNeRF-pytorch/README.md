# HashNeRF-pytorch
[Instant-NGP](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp) recently introduced a Multi-resolution Hash Encoding for neural graphics primitives like [NeRFs](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf). The original NVIDIA implementation mainly in C++/CUDA, based on [tiny-cuda-nn](https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn), can train NeRFs upto 100x faster!

This project is a **pure PyTorch** implementation of [Instant-NGP](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp), built with the purpose of enabling AI Researchers to play around and innovate further upon this method.

This project is built on top of the super-useful [NeRF-pytorch](https://github.com/yenchenlin/nerf-pytorch) implementation.

## Convergence speed w.r.t. Vanilla NeRF

After training for just 5k iterations (~10 minutes on a single 1050Ti), you start seeing a _crisp_ chair rendering. :)

# Instructions
Download the nerf-synthetic dataset from here: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JDdLGDruGNXWnM1eqY1FNL9PlStjaKWi).

To train a `chair` HashNeRF model:
```
python run_nerf.py --config configs/chair.txt --finest_res 512 --log2_hashmap_size 19 --lrate 0.01 --lrate_decay 10
```

To train for other objects like `ficus`/`hotdog`, replace `configs/chair.txt` with `configs/{object}.txt`:

![hotdog_ficus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8559512/154066554-d3656d4a-1738-427c-982d-3ef4e4071969.gif)

## Extras
The code-base has additional support for:
* Total Variation Loss for smoother embeddings (use `--tv-loss-weight` to enable)
* Sparsity-inducing loss on the ray weights (use `--sparse-loss-weight` to enable)

## ScanNet dataset support
The repo now supports training a NeRF model on a scene from the ScanNet dataset. I personally found setting up the ScanNet dataset to be a bit tricky. Please find some instructions/notes in [ScanNet.md](ScanNet.md).


## TODO:
* Voxel pruning during training and/or inference
* Accelerated ray tracing, early ray termination
